                    <p>Campus Share was founded on a simple idea: access is better than ownership. We are the
                        first peer-to-peer "Library of Things" exclusively for the KNUST community. We connect students
                        who have things with students who need them, creating a sustainable and affordable ecosystem
                        right here on campus. We don't own any items; we simply provide the secure platform that makes
                        sharing possible.</p>
